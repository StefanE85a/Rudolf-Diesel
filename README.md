# Rudolf Diesel: The Man Behind a Revolution

## <u>About this Project</u>

Welcome to the Readme of a dedicated website to exploring the life and legacy of Rudolf Diesel,
the renowned inventor of the diesel engine. This website aims to provide a minor
overview of Diesel's contributions to mechanical engineering and the impact of his
innovations on industrial and transportation sectors.

This is a project at Code Institute and serves as an informative resource for those interested
in the history of engineering and industrial innovation. By diving into Diesel's life and work,
I aim to provide an understanding of the man behind a key technological advancement
that continues to play a vital role in our world.
